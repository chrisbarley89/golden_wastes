When you weave a performance into a basic spell, choose an ally and an effect:
* Heal 1d8 damage
* +1d4 forward to damage
* Their mind is shaken clear of one enchantment
* The next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they get +2 instead of +1
Then roll+Cha. ✴On a 10+, the ally gets the selected effect. ✴On a 7-9, your spell still works, but you draw unwanted attention or your magic reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM’s choice.
