When you work with your animal companion on something it’s trained in…
* …and you attack the same target, add its ferocity to your damage
* …and you track, add its cunning to your roll
* …and you take damage, add its armor to your armor
* …and you discern realities, add its cunning to your roll
* …and you parley, add its cunning to your roll
* …and someone interferes with you, add its instinct to their roll
