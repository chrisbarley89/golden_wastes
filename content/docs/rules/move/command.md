## Ranger Starting Move
{{< infobox name="Command" type="Starting" class="Ranger" >}}

When you work with your animal companion on something it’s trained in…
  * …and you attack the same target, add its ferocity to your damage
  * …and you track, add its cunning to your roll
  * …and you take damage, add its armor to your armor
  * …and you discern realities, add its cunning to your roll
  * …and you parley, add its cunning to your roll
  * …and someone interferes with you, add its instinct to their roll
