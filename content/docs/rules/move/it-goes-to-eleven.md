## Bard Advanced Move
{{< infobox name="It Goes To Eleven" type="Advanced" class="Bard" >}}

When you unleash a crazed performance (a righteous lute solo or mighty brass blast, maybe) choose a target who can hear you and roll+Cha. ✴On a 10+ the target attacks their nearest ally in range. ✴On a 7–9 they attack their nearest ally, but you also draw their attention and ire.
