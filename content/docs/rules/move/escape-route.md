## Thief Expert Move
{{< infobox name="Escape Route" type="Expert" class="Thief" >}}

When you’re in too deep and need a way out, name your escape route and roll+DEX. ✴On a 10+ you’re gone. ✴On a 7–9 you can stay or go, but if you go it costs you: leave something behind or take something with you, the GM will tell you what.
