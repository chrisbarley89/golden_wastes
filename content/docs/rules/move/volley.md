##  Basic Move
{{< infobox name="Volley" type="Basic" class="" >}}

When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, roll+Dex. On a 10+ you have a clear shot—deal your damage. On a 7–9, choose one (whichever you choose you deal your damage):
- You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger of the GM’s choice
- You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage
- You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one.
