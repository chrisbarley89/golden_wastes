##  Basic Move
{{< infobox name="Defy Danger" type="Basic" class="" >}}

When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it:
- …by powering through, +Str
- …by getting out of the way or acting fast, +Dex
- …by enduring, +Con
- …with quick thinking, +Int
- …through mental fortitude, +Wis
- …using charm and social grace, +Cha
On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear. On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.
