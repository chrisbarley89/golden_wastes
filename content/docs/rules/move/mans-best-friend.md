## Ranger Advanced Move
{{< infobox name="Man’s Best Friend" type="Advanced" class="Ranger" >}}

When you allow your animal companion to take a blow that was meant for you, the damage is negated and your animal companion’s ferocity becomes 0. If its ferocity is already 0 you can’t use this ability. When you have a few hours of rest with your animal companion its ferocity returns to normal.
