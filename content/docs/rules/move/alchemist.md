## Thief Expert Move
{{< infobox name="Alchemist" type="Expert" class="Thief" >}}

Replaces: Brewer

When you have you have time to gather materials and a safe place to brew you can create three doses of any poison you’ve used before. Alternately you can describe the effects of a poison you’d like to create. The GM will tell you that you can create it, but with one or more caveats:
  * It will only work under specific circumstances
  * The best you can manage is a weaker version
  * It’ll take a while to take effect
  * It’ll have obvious side effects
