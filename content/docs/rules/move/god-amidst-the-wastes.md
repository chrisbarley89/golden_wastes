## Ranger Advanced Move
{{< infobox name="God Amidst the Wastes" type="Advanced" class="Ranger" >}}

Dedicate yourself to a deity (name a new one or choose one thatâ€™s already been established). You gain the commune and cast a spell cleric moves. When you select this move, treat yourself as a cleric of level 1 for using spells. Every time you gain a level thereafter, increase your effective cleric level by 1.
