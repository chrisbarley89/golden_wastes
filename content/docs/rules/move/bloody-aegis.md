## Paladin Advanced Move
{{< infobox name="Bloody Aegis" type="Advanced" class="Paladin" >}}

When you take damage you can grit your teeth and accept the blow. If you do you take no damage but instead suffer a debility of your choice. If you already have all six debilities you canâ€™t use this move.
