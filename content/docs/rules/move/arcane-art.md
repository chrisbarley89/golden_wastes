## Bard Starting Move
{{< infobox name="Arcane Art" type="Starting" class="Bard" >}}

When you weave a performance into a basic spell, choose an ally and an effect:
  * Heal 1d8 damage
  * +1d4 forward to damage
  * Their mind is shaken clear of one enchantment
  * The next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they get +2 instead of +1
Then roll+Cha. ✴On a 10+, the ally gets the selected effect. ✴On a 7-9, your spell still works, but you draw unwanted attention or your magic reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM’s choice.
